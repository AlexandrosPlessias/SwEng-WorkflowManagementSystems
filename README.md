# Workflow-Management-Systems
Software Engineering: Workflow Management Systems:
Here I implement the tasks of "sweng-exercise.pdf" with the use of Visual Paradigm porgramme for a Workflow Management Systems. When we talk about Workflow Management, we refer to the (automated) coordination, control and execution of processes, which include combinations of activities performed by humans or machines and in particular those that involve interaction with applications and IT tools. Finally, Workflow Management Systems are information systems that define, model, manage, and execute an organization's Workflows. A workflow management system provides the ability to define the steps to be followed in each business process, assigning steps to roles (eg customer, loan department executive, etc.), documents / data required at each stage ( eg application, contract, cadastral extract).

The phases to be performed are the following:
* Elicitation/Recording of requirements
* Requirement Analysis
* Pseudo-user interface design
* Create a class chart
* Highlighting subsystems


To open "SWEG_2016.vpp" programme you need to download the Visual Paradigm from here: https://www.visual-paradigm.com/download/ (30 day free trial).

Visual Paradigm is a software tool designed for software development teams to model business information system and manage development processes. Visual Paradigm supports key industry modeling languages and standards such as Unified Modeling Language (UML), SoaML, BPMN, XMI, etc. https://www.visual-paradigm.com/
